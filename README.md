# Doctor-Boardroom-Voting-App

University project. Achieved grade 97%.

## Details of the task

The use of computers, computation and mobile electronic devices is becoming standard practice
within health service environments. Clinicians are now routinely using tablets and other mobile
devices to view and share medical information. Computation and the widespread use of
software and the Internet has permitted sophisticated techniques, and a wide variety of
approaches to analyse, communicate, visualise and alert on patient medical data. Key
developments have added useful functionality for clinicians to complete their work in a more
efficient, safe and better informed manner. This project is concerned with utilising the wider
access of clinical specialists to increased patient medical data via a software solution: Clinicians
will register on the app and be able to access a relevant patient’s current details and status. Each
clinician will then be able to register what, in their opinion, is the optimum actions to take for
the patient. In this way a voting system is established, as usually observed in company
boardrooms, among the clinicians whereby the best outcomes for the particular patient emerge
from the clinicians’ interactions.

You and your team are required to work on the software development project A Doctor
Boardroom Voting App. The proposed App will be used as a patient status discussion system; to
provide accurate, up-to-date patient data, allow a wide ranging discussion on the patient’s
medical details and establish a voting mechanism for the clinicians to recommend the best
course of action based on the patients’ status in hospital. This will aid the neurological society
and other health care professionals by providing them with informed crowd sourced opinions.
This crowd sourcing opinion App will help improve the ability of practitioners to diagnose
diseases accurately and reduce - even prevent - medical errors, as well as provide official health
figures and a robust base for decision makers. The Boardroom voting System helps clinicians to
make safer therapeutic decisions and write reliable prescriptions.
